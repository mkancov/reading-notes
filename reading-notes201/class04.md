 *This topic is important because it it going over things that I didn't previouslty know how to do.*

 ## Things I want to know more about

 - more types of useful positioning in css to make my pages look better

 - Want to try and make my links look like normal text to see if it looks better on my websites. (Cleaner look)

**HTML**

1. To create a basic link you wrsp the text or content in <a> tags.

2. The href attribute contains the web address and is known as the hypertext reference.

3. You can ensure that a link is accessible to all users by putting the title info in the regular text.

**CSS Layout**

1. Normal flow is the way the webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.

2. a block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of Inline elements is just the size of their content. You can't set width or height on inline elements â€” they just sit inside the content of block level elements. If you want to control the size of an inline element in this manner, you need to set it to behave like a block level element.

3. Static positioning is the default for every html element. 

4. absolute positioned elements sit on their own layer which lets you make isolated Ul features that dont interfere with other element layouts. Another cool feature is that you can specify the distance of the element and each containing elemt's side.

5. one key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is that absolute fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. (An exception to this occurs if one of the element's ancestors is a fixed containing block because its transform property has a value other than none.) This means that you can create useful UI items that are fixed in place, like persistent navigation menus that are always visible no matter how much the page scrolls.

**JS**

1. Invocation is running or executing an operation and declaration is creating an actual function.

2. Parameters are properties of a function and arguments are properties of a particular call to a function.

**MISC**

Pair programming could be useful by having an extra pair of eyes to double check your code and vice versa, it would also be good because you could essentially complete double the amount of work at once.
