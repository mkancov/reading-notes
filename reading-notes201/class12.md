# Reading

This topic is important because it gave info about charts and the canvas element which seems much easier and more visually appealing than tables.

## Things I want to know more about

- I want to use the canvas element because I don't know what it means by draw

- The chart.js seems cool.

### JavaScript Canvas

1. The canvas eleemnt allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.

2. The canvas elemt requires a closing tag, unlike img. Any content between the opening and closing tag is fallback content that displays if the browser diesn't support the canvas element, but most do.

3. getContext returns a render context object. getContext takes one argument which is the type of context and you can later access content by calling it.

### Chart.js Documentation

1. Chart.js lets you add charts into your javascript easily, and all you need to do is a a canvas element and your chart.js script.

2. Bar charts, pie charts, and scatter charts.

### Animated Charts with chart.js

1. Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. Theyâ€™re easier to look at and convey data quickly.

2. They could be helpful for something I previously created by using them instead of the table which was hard to create in the Salmon cookies assignment.
