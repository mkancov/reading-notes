# Reading

**This is an important topic because I dont know about constructors and I am looking forward to learning more about tables.

## Things I want to know more about

- The final question which asks for an analogy 

- More domain modeling examples

- Creating tables on my own 

- trying a constructor in place of my regular object literals. 

### Domain Modeling

1. We need **Domain Modeling** to clarify domain specific terms. It is a way to describe and model real world entities and the relation between them.

### Html Table basics

1. Tables shouldn't be used for page layouts because theymake it difficult for visually impaired people, make code harder to write, maintain, and debug, and they are not auto responsive. 

2. <td> is used to make a single cell and each one makes a row grow longer. <tr> stands for table row and creates a second row so that the first row doesn't go on forever. <th> are specialcells that go at the start of a row or column and define the type of data that row or column contains.

### Introducing Constructors

1. A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword. Creates a new object, runs the code in the constructor, and returns the new object.

2. In a constructor you use 'this' to bind to the new object so you can refer o it in your constructor code.
