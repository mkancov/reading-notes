# Class 2 Reading

This is relevant and important because I am learning basics that I can re-visit in the future if I forget anything.

## Things I want to know more about

- Semantics that translate through different coding laguages

- If i prefer to use external or internal stylesheets 

- I would love to get better at using if/else statements.

**Intro to HTML**

1. Semantics give the text meaning so the browser can display it properly.

2. There are 6 heading elements. 

3. Superscript and subscript are good for when you occasionally need  to mark up items like dates, chemical formulas, and mathematical equations so they have the correct meaning.

4. provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use, along with the <abbr> to mark up the abbreviation.

**Learn CSS**

1. External stylesheet, internal stylesheet, and inline styles.

2. Inline styles are harder to read, less efficent, time consuming, and take multiple edits, making them the worst of the 3 options. 

3. h2 is the selector, black and 5px are the declarations and color and black are the properties.

**Learn JS**

1. A string is the data type that is a sequence of text enclosed in single quotes.

2. assignment, comparison, arithmetic, and logical are 4 operators in JS.

3. You could use a function to multiple multiple numbers at once and call for a result. 

**Conditionals**

1. An if statement checks a code and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.

2. If/else statements allow your code to run properly and take 2 different routes based on true or false. 

3. block, switch, and conitionsal operators are 3 types of comparison operators.

4. the && operator only returns true when both of its operands are true (and false in all other cases), while the || operator only returns false when both of its operands are false (and true in all other cases).
