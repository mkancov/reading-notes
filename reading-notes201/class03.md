# Reading

**This topic is important because it explains the core fundementals of how to code with HTML, CSS, and JS that we will have to constantly use. The readings help to drill the points in through writing.

## Things I want to know more about

- how to write good loops

- I want to make a cool page with css using padding, border, and margin

- I dont think that I properly evaulated the array

- Getting better at using if/else instead of onlyu being able to use "switch".

### HTML

**Lists**

1. The ul element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless.

2. type- The attribute that sets the bullet style for an unordered list. Can make bullets into a circle, square, disc, or triangle.

3. When using an ordered list, the order is meaningful and use an unordered list when the order doesn't matter.

4. I for uppercase roman numerals or i for lowercase roman numerals.

**Learn CSS**

- Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box. The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties. The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.

- Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height

- Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties

- Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.

- Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties. 

**Learn JS**

- Various data types can be stored in an array. strings, numbers, objects, and other arrays too.

- The people array is a valid JavaScript array. Access any part of the array by using people[0] = 'Pete'; console.log(people) and this will return your array however you choose to set it.

*five shorthand operators*

- Assignment operators assign a value to its left operand based on the value of it's right operand.

- Comparison Operators compares it's operands and returns a logical value based on whther the comparison is true or false.

- Arithmetic Operators take numerical values as their operands and return a single value.

- Logical Operators are used with *boolean* values and return a boolean value but if they aren't then they return a non-boolean value.

- Unary Operator is a unary operation with only one operand.

*Evaluate* 

let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

(a + c) + b;

- I don't think this would be able to be evaluated because of the 3 different types of data, particularly the false boolean.

**Conditional Statements** 

- If you are feeling good then go outside and get some exercise or else, if you are feeling sick than stay inside and rest. This could be made into and if/else statement. 

**Loop**

- Loops are all about doing the same thing over and over again. Often, the code will be slightly different each time round the loop, or the same code will run but with different variables.

- example: A loop can be useful in javascript if you want to repeat an image a certain amount of times and it can also vary each time.
