*This topic is important because we it can teach us more about CSS so our pages look cleaner.*

**Things I want to know more about**

- I want to spend some time on our new websites working with Flexbox and trying it out.

### Learn CSS-Flexbox

1. The Flexible Box Layout Model (flexbox) is a layout model designed for one-dimensional content. It excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.

2. The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column.

3. You should be cautious when using any properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document, as it can negatively impact accessibility. The row-reverse and column-reverse values are a good example of this. The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order.

### CSS Layout-Flexbox

1. Flexbox can be more useful than float sometimes because it makes layout designs that are difficult to achieve or or impossible more convenient and do-able.

2. This topic connects with my long term goals because it gives me a new option when using CSS that makes things flow easier and can ultimately help me to make nicer looking pages.
