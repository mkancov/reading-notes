*This topic is important because I think we're going to be making web forms in class today so it gives a little prior knowledge to all of us instead of going in, knowing nothing.*

## Things I want to know more about

- Event bubbling and capturing because I don't think I completely understood it.

- Overall I just want to try and create a form today because it doesn't look hard but I'm sure it can be tricky.

### Html Forms

1. Forms are important because they are a communication bridge that allow the user and company or vice versa to communicate to each other.

2. Having an overall simple and easy setup to understand is going to make your form easier for the user to use your form.

3. the **label** element allows you to define a label for an Html form wiget and helps with accesibility. The **form** element formally defines a form and attributes that determine the form's behavior. The **fieldset** element is a convenient way to create groups of widgets that share the same purpose, for styling and semantic purposes.  The text content of the **legend** formally describes the purpose of the fieldset it is included inside. The **button** element creates a clickable button on the screen for users.

### Learn JS

1. Events are actions that happen in the system you are creating, the system sends signals when an event occurs.

2. When using the **addeventlistener()** you will need the name of th event and a function, so you need a string and function.

3. A parameter specified with a name like "event" inside an event handler function. They're useful because they are short and easy to remember for develoeprs.

4. Event bubbling and capturing are two different phases. Capturing phase checks to see if the element's outermost ancestor has a click event handler then moves sto the next element inside html. Bubbling phase does the opposite, it cheks to see if the direct parent of the clicked element has a handler registered then moves to the next immediate ancestor eleemt until it reaches the html element.
