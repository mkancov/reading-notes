# Reading

*This topic is important because it increases my CSS knowledge.

## What I want to know more about

- More about transitions and animations

- how to use animations vs transitions and when

### CSS Transforms

1. General layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

2. Rotating an image or a box on a 2D field. 

### CSS Transitions & Animations

1. For a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

2. When more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.

### Cool CSS Transitions

1. CSS transitions offer you a way to create simple animations that always start as the result of triggering a CSS property change.

2. This topic fits in with my long term goals because I want to be proficent in front end even though I want to be a back end developer. I need to be able to use CSS effectively to have nice looking websites.
