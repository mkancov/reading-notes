### Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

1. Local storage allows a developer to store data in a user's browser like cookies but they dont expire and it isn't sent as a request.

2. Local storage shouldn't be used for sensitive info like passwords and personal information in case of exploitation.

3. Using local storage in modern browsers is ridiculously easy. All you have to do is modify the localStorage object in JavaScript. You can do that directly or (and this is probably cleaner) use the setItem() and getItem() method. You can only store keys and values.
