# Reading

**This is an important topic because we are moving on to a new lesson tomorrow and that marks the beginning of a new week and most likely a new project that we will have to use this info for.

## Things I want to know more about

- how to use the DOM

- Want to learn more about Object Literals and how to apply them to my code.

- Better understand how they are different from arrays.

**JavaScript Object Basics**

1. An object is a collection of data that has multiple varibales and functions.

2. Object literals are good for keeping your code organzied and in my opinion is the biggest advanrage of using them.

3. Objects can be accessed in any order and an array can be accessed using a numerical index. The main difference is the way that they store data.

4. If an object property name is defined at runtime then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can pass the name as a variable inside brackets.

5. The "this" keyword refers to the current object the code is being written inside. when you only have to create a single object literal, it's not so useful. But if you create more than one, this enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create.

**Introduction to the Dom** 

1. The DOM stands for Document Object Model and it is the data representation of the ojects that compromise the structure and content of a document on the internet.

2. Since the DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
