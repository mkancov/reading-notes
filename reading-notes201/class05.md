**This is an important topic for me because I am not great at CSS right now and I can get extra practice like this.**

## Things I want to know more about

- I want to see the pjysical difference between an svg and a gif.

- Try out different fonts to see if there are any that dont upload properly.

**HTML Media**

1. Alt is good for when you want to explain what a picture is for someone who might not be able to see it.

2. Add alt text and title to improve accesibilty.

3. The figure tag specifies self contained content like photos or illustrations.

4. An svg image will always look more clear on screen instead of a gif because an svh is scaleable and looks good in high resolution or zoomed in.

5. PNG is the best for your website because there isn't much color data to worry about.

**Learn CSS**

1. At a fundamental level, the color property defines the foreground color of an HTML element's content and the background-color property defines the element's background color. These can be used on just about any element.

2. I would give the background a color and also the text a color by using the color property and specifying where you want color applied. example- p {color: blue;} would make your text blue in the paragraph.

3. You should consider picking a generic font so that it is available across all systems.

4. font-size allows you to change the amount of pixels which makes text size change. Font weight sets how bold the font is and font-style allows you to change the style of writing.

5. You could add letter-spacing which adds natural spacing between characters while rendering text. Word-spacing is another good option that sets the length of space between words and tags.
