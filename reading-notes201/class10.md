*This is an important topic because I dont know how to troubleshoot outside of console.log.*

## Things I want to know more about

- I want to try out the JavaScript debugger

- Try to troubleshoot my own code

- breakpoints

### Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Syntax error's are when you write your code incorrectly and logic errors are when you write your code correctly but get an anser you didn't expect.

2. I've mainly gotten a bunch of syntax errors in JavaScript because I consnstantly forget semicolons, and paranthesis vs brackets and things like that. I have to be more attentive after each line and remember small things. I get logic errors also, where I feel like I have things right and my code comes back as undefined or doesn't log anything at all.

3. This topic will continue to influence my long term goals because it keeps me focused on each line of code that I writr so I don't have to go back and fix it over and over, also learning the Syntax has helped.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables in your code and set breaks, which pause your code so that you can look for any bugs before you run it.

2. A breakpoint is what pauses the execution of your code and let's you evaluate before it is executed. 

3. The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line
