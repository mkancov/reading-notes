*This topic is important because we are bein introduced to new topics that are supposed to make things easier for us and webpagrs better

## Things I want to know more about

- I didn't completely undertstand srcset and would like to understand how to implement it better.

- Want to ttry using video and audio elements

- Try grid instead of flex

- Resposnive images seemed confusing to me.

### Video and Audio Content

1. In the same way as for the <img> element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way. You must either use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate JavaScript API. At a minimum, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.

2. fallback content — this will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the <video> element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers.

3. Video and audio are different than before because they dont have the accessibility and security issues that they did in the early 2000s.

### Grid

1. Flexbox is also a very great layout tool, but its one-directional flow has different use cases — and they actually work together quite well! Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we’ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we’ve been making websites.

2. The element on which display: grid is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items. In this example container is the grid container. The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column grid lines”) or horizontal (“row grid lines”) and reside on either side of a row or column. The children (direct descendants) of the grid container are grid items.

### Responsive images

1. Because it helps to improve the performace of webpaages across various devices, wespecailly now that there are so many phones and tablets instead of only large monitors.

2. srcset defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is. sizes defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true.

3. Because it allows the browser decide the best reolution possible depending on each person's device who is on the page.
