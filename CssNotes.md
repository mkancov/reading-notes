# CSS Notes

**What is CSS**

CSS allows you to create nice looking pages that appeal to the average user. It is a text styler.

**CSS Syntax**

*Example*

h1 {Color: blue;  Font Size:10em;}

1. We are styling h1 which is the header.
2. The curly brackets indicate what it is that you want to do to the header.
3. Declare the color to be blue and the font size to be 10. Seperate them with semicolons. 

### How to add CSS

**Three ways to insert css**

- External CSS  can change the entire look of a website by changing one file

- Internal CSS is used if one HTML page has a unique style


- Inline CSS is used to apply a unique style for a single element
