# Git

**What is Git?**

*Snapshots*

Each time you save a changed portion of your project this is known as a commit. Git creates a snapshot and keeps a reference to it.

*Local Operations*

Git allows you to work when not online and without use of a VPN because your project history is in a local disk.

*Tracking changes*

Detects file corruption or loss of info.

*States*

Files in Git can be either committed, modified, or staged.

- Committed means data is stored securely in a local database

- Modified is when the file has been changed but not committed

- Staged is when a file will be committed in the next snapshot.

**Git commands**

- cd means change directory

- Git add 

- Git clone

- Git status

- Git push origin main

- mv means move

- Git commmit -m""
