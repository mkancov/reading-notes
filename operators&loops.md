# Operators and Loops

### expressions and Operators

An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

The precedence of opeerators determines the order they are applied when evaluation an expression. (Kind of like PEMDAS)

**Assignment Operators**  
An *Assignment Operator* assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.  
The simple assignment operator is = 

**Comparison Operators**  
A *Comparison Operator* compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.

**Arithmetic Operators**  
An *Arithmetic Operator* takes numerical values as their operands and returns a single numerical value.  
Addition, subtraction, multipliction, and division.

**Bitwise Operators**  
A *Bitwise Operator* treats their operands as a set of 32 bits rather than as a decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers. 

**Logical Operators**  
*Logical Operators* are typically used with boolean values, when used like this, they retyrn a boolean value (true or false).  
If not used with boolean values, they may return a non boolean value.
